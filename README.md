Hydrogen Framework
================================================================================================

This is a simple to use framework which we use internally. 
We decided to make it free for everyone! 
Hopefully it helps someone out a bit :)


Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Unity 4.x

Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are cloning this repository you will more then likely need to copy it 
into the working folder of your Unity project.

If you've downloaded the Asset Store version, its already installed for you :)


Folders
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Components ###
Here is where you find some premade drag and drop components to drop on to your GameObjects, or
you can add them by the quick add button. We've prefixed all of our component based scripts with
'h' so that they can be easily found and identified.

### Plugins ###
This is where bulk of the code is kept. It is issolated in its own namespace as to not interfere
with anything else.

### Shaders ###
Pretty self explanitory don't you think?


Support
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any issues can be reported @ http://github.com/dotBunny/Hydrogen/issues

Due to time commitments to our normal projects, support may be very limited.
